# ATM328-ASM
An AVR bootloader designed specifically for the ATmega328p MCU, with SPI programming interface support.<br />
**This implementation has not been fully tested for confirmed functionality.**

## Features
* Lightweight and fast.
* Error handling.
* Error status LED indicator.
* Ready/on status LED indicator.

## Sample application

The electrical schematic and BoM for this prototype PCB can be found in `/prototype`.

## Flashing the MCU
Requires a supported ISP programmer and avrdude flash software. A USBasp Chinese clone is used in this example.<br />

Using the sample prototype PCB, connect the USBasp to the correct pin headers. Refer to the schematic of the prototype for correct pin mapping.<br /><br />

Use the following commands to flash the bootloader to the MCU:<br />

```
avrdude.exe -c usbasp-clone -P usb -p m328p -U lock:w:0x3f:m -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xde:m -U efuse:w:0xfd:m
avrdude.exe -c usbasp-clone -P usb -p m328p -U flash:w:ATM328-ASM.hex -U lock:w:0x0f:m
```

**Notice: A driver may be required for your programmer to work.**


## Compilation
Use AVRASM2 assembler (Atmel Studio).
